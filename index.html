    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is structured as a single-page dashboard with a fixed sidebar for primary navigation (Prelims, Mains, Interview) and a main content area. This structure was chosen to provide immediate access to the different stages of the exam without overwhelming the user with a long scrollable page. The content within each section is organized into interactive accordions, allowing users to drill down from papers to subjects and then to specific topics. This hierarchical drill-down method is highly intuitive for exploring a dense, structured document like a syllabus. A key interaction is the live search bar, which highlights keywords across the entire syllabus, transforming the static text into a powerful study tool for finding and connecting topics. This design prioritizes usability and efficient information retrieval over a literal one-to-one mapping of the source document's linear layout. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: UPSC Exam Structure. Goal: Provide a quick, high-level overview of the Mains examination components. Viz/Presentation Method: Doughnut Chart. Interaction: Hovering over segments shows the paper count. Justification: A visual chart is more engaging and easier to digest than a list of papers, immediately communicating the exam's composition. Library/Method: Chart.js (Canvas). Report Info: Detailed Syllabus Text. Goal: Organize and present dense hierarchical information clearly. Viz/Presentation Method: Nested Accordions. Interaction: Clicking headers expands or collapses sections to reveal details on demand. Justification: Prevents information overload and allows users to focus on one section at a time. Library/Method: HTML/CSS/JS. Report Info: Entire Syllabus. Goal: Allow users to quickly find specific topics. Viz/Presentation Method: Search Bar with Highlighting. Interaction: As the user types, matching text is highlighted in real-time. Justification: This is a critical feature for a study tool, enabling efficient topic search and cross-referencing. Library/Method: JS. -->
